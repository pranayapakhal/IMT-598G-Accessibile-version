      <h2 id="course-description">Course / class description</h2>

      <p>This course has three primary areas of focus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Foundational IM knowledge</strong> – promoting a solid foundation of knowledge in the Information Management discipline.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis of emerging IM trends</strong> – using Gartner’s Hype Cycle and other resources to understand and analyze the impact of current IM trends on students’ careers and lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional development</strong> – facilitating the design and planning of your career using design thinking practices and professional skills development.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Prior to each class session, please ensure that you have read all assigned materials so you can come prepared to participate.
        The goal of each class session is to hear from the professor about the topic of the week, gain insight via readings and other
        work completed outside of class, and then share thoughts and opinions in class with others. We will also actively engage in
        hands-on work together in class and share that work with the group.
      </p>

      <p>Each class will generally be divided into sections such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Outstanding issues, clarification points, assignment discussions.</li>
        <li>Topic presentation and discussion from students.</li>
        <li>Interactive group activities and design challenges.</li>
        <li>Group session sharing and discussion.</li>
        <li>Wrap up and overview of upcoming work.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For complete dates and weekly topics, see the Course Schedule page.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Writing & teamwork -->
    <section aria-labelledby="writing-teamwork">
      <h2 id="writing-teamwork">Writing, teamwork, and responsibilities</h2>

      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p>
        This class involves producing a number of written deliverables, as being able to write effectively and efficiently is a crucial professional skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are expected to read the course writing guide and understand the expectations for writing in this class, including what instructors will look for and evaluate in your assignments. The guide is designed to help you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhance your writing skills and express ideas clearly.</li>
        <li>Strengthen your professional writing capabilities.</li>
        <li>Use tools such as ChatGPT responsibly to support revision and clarity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Teamwork</h3>
      <p>
        During this class you will work on a number of assignments and activities as a team. Developing teamwork skills is critical,
        as information management systems often require many people working together to solve complex problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is critical that all team members participate in all group assignments, including in-class group workshops. If one or more
        teammates are not participating in every team activity, you must email the instructor as soon as possible. Do not wait until
        the end of the quarter to report a lack of contribution.
      </p>

      <h3>Individual responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Research and content creation:</strong> thoroughly research and create content for assigned sections, use reliable sources, and cite appropriately.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality control:</strong> ensure your work is clear, concise, and free of errors (grammar, spelling, factual accuracy).</li>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> coordinate with teammates to ensure your section aligns with others and contributes to a cohesive whole.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Collective responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overall quality:</strong> the team is collectively responsible for academic integrity, accuracy, and presentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> meet deadlines, respect each other’s views, and present the work professionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and revisions:</strong> review feedback together and make necessary revisions to meet or exceed expectations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Individual grading and consequences</h3>
      <p>
        Each student may receive an individual grade that reflects their contribution to the group’s work and deliverables. This approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encourages equal participation and effort.</li>
        <li>Acknowledges each member’s accountability.</li>
        <li>Motivates students to contribute constructively to team success.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are not contributing, you may receive a grade of 0 points for each group project assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If conflicts cannot be resolved internally within a group, there is a process to warn a team member and, in extreme cases,
        remove them from the team. Refer to the teamwork guide for full details.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <p>
        Excused absences for religious observation will be granted in accordance with University of Washington policy.
        If you need to miss class, communicate with your instructor and team members to minimize impact and determine
        options for making up missed work.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Assignments and grading -->
    <section aria-labelledby="assignments-grading">
      <h2 id="assignments-grading">Assignments and grading</h2>

      <p>
        All assignments are to be completed and submitted individually or as a group, according to the instructions for each assignment.
        Full assignment details and due dates are available on the Assignments page.
      </p>

      <p>
        This course uses the iSchool Graduate Grading Scheme, which converts percentage grades into 4.0 grades.
      </p>

      <h3>Late policy</h3>
      <p>
        You are expected to submit all work by the deadline. This respects the time your instructor and grader have set aside for
        timely feedback.
      </p>

      <h3>Extenuating circumstances</h3>
      <p>
        If extenuating circumstances prevent you from submitting on time, contact your instructor. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Situations related to physical or mental health.</li>
        <li>Caring for someone who is ill.</li>
        <li>Death of a family member or loved one.</li>
        <li>Your laptop being stolen or becoming inoperable.</li>
        <li>Network outages or power failures.</li>
        <li>Similar unexpected circumstances.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please do not send documentation such as medical notes or photographs; a short email explaining the situation is sufficient.
        If you feel you need to lie, talk to the instructor instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        By general iSchool policy, weddings and other family celebrations do not warrant an extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have not contacted your instructor before the due date, 10% will be deducted from your final score for each day the
        assignment is late. Assignments submitted more than seven days late will not be accepted and will receive a 0.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Generative AI tools -->
    <section aria-labelledby="ai-tools">
      <h2 id="ai-tools">Use of generative AI tools</h2>

      <p>
        The responsible use of AI tools is an important skill. We encourage you to explore how such tools work and to experiment with
        different tools in order to understand their limits, effective uses, and potential harms and benefits.
      </p>

      <p>In this course, responsible use of AI tools means that you will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop skills for using AI tools to enrich and strengthen your work and support your learning.</li>
        <li>Cite the use of AI tools and explain how they were used (for example, editing, translation, or research support).</li>
        <li>Verify the accuracy of content generated by AI tools.</li>
        <li>Seek to understand and address biases inherent in AI tools, noting their limitations when appropriate.</li>
        <li>Not copy and paste AI output and present it as your own work.</li>
        <li>Clearly distinguish your own work from the work of other sources, including AI.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In all use of AI tools, you must conform to UW’s policies on academic integrity and conduct
        (see Student Governance &amp; Policies, chapter 209, section 7 on prohibited conduct).
      </p>
    </section>

        authentication. Information about logging in is available on the Libraries’ “Connecting to the Libraries” page.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Policies & conduct -->
    <section aria-labelledby="policies">
      <h2 id="policies">Policies, conduct, and community</h2>

      <h3>Academic conduct</h3>
      <p>
        Please review the iSchool Academic Policies, which address academic and behavioral misconduct, academic integrity, copyright,
        privacy, concerns about a course, and evaluation of student work.
      </p>

      <h3>Inclusivity</h3>
      <p>
        The Information School is committed to creating and sustaining an inclusive learning environment. Your unique experiences and
        perspectives are valuable contributions to our collective learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to truth and rationality, the free exchange of ideas, and treating all with respect and dignity. We all share
        responsibility for creating a learning community free of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
      </p>

      <h3>Land acknowledgement</h3>
      <p>
        We acknowledge that the University of Washington sits on the land of the Coast Salish peoples, which touches the shared
        waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish, Tulalip, and Muckleshoot nations. At the beginning of the quarter, we
        pause to consider the past, present, and future of this place.
      </p>

      <h3>Pronoun usage</h3>
      <p>
        To help create a welcoming, safe, and inclusive environment, you are invited to share your pronouns if you wish. Whether you
        share them or not is up to you. Please use pronouns with care and respect.
      </p>

      <h3>Religious accommodations</h3>
      <p>
        Washington state law requires that UW provide a policy for accommodating student absences or significant hardship due to
        reasons of faith or conscience or for organized religious activities. For full details and the request process, refer to the UW
        Religious Accommodations policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Students with disabilities</h3>
      <p>
        To request academic accommodations due to a disability, contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS). If you have a letter
        from DRS indicating that you require accommodations, please share it with the instructor so that appropriate arrangements can
        be made.
      </p>

      <h3>Academic integrity</h3>
      <p>
        Academic life relies on respect for the ideas of others and their rights to those ideas. When you use the ideas or materials of
        others, you must provide citation. The format is flexible as long as the source can be located and verified.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions about citation or academic honesty, ask your instructor. You are encouraged to visit the Writing Center
        for help using citations ethically and effectively.
      </p>

      <h3>Affirmation of inclusion and safe space</h3>
      <p>
        The iSchool is committed to maintaining an environment where every member of the community feels welcome to participate in
        the life of the university, free from harassment and discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        This class is a safe space for all students. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, queer-identified, and transgender students
        are welcome and encouraged to be an integral part of the class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Expressions of ideas in this class that are fixed in any tangible medium, such as digital or physical documents, are protected
        by copyright law. This includes student work (assignments, discussion posts) and instructor materials (syllabus, assignments,
        reading lists, lectures).
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the bounds of fair use, you may copy these materials for your personal educational use, but redistribution beyond the
        course community may violate copyright. If unsure, ask the instructor.
      </p>

      <p>
        To support an environment of rigorous discussion and open expression, we must respect each other’s right to privacy. Do not
        share personally identifiable information about classmates or instructors without consent.
      </p>

      <h3>Student Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>
        Good student conduct is important for maintaining a healthy course environment. Please familiarize yourself with the
        University of Washington’s Student Code of Conduct.
      </p>
